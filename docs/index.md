**This is an alpha version! It might break sometimes!**

**Trivia**: The name *Pytanis* is a reference to [Prytanis] using the typical *py* prefix of [Python] tools. [Prytanis]
was the name given  to the leading members of the government of a city (polis) in ancient Greece.  Offices that used this
title usually had responsibility for presiding over councils of some kind, which met in the [Prytaneion]. Romani ite domum!
